# Gen AI Terminology

## ðŸ§  What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?

- A type of AI model that focuses on language.
- It understands and generates human-like text.

**Examples**:

- GPT-3 / GPT-4 by OpenAI
- BERT by Google
- LLaMA by Meta

**Use cases**: Chatbots, email writing, summarizing articles, coding help, translation.

## ðŸ“¦ What is a Foundational Model (FM)?

- A large, general-purpose AI model trained on a variety of data (text, images, code, etc.).
- Can be adapted for many different tasks â€” not just language.

**Examples**:

- GPT-4 (with vision) â€“ handles text + images
- Gemini by Google â€“ handles text, code, audio, video, images
- Claude by Anthropic â€“ general-purpose reasoning
- Grok by xAI â€“ general AI assistant

**Use cases**: Chat, visual analysis, image generation, speech recognition, document understanding, and more.

| **Feature**         | **LLM (Large Language Model)** | **Foundational Model (FM)**              |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**           | Language only                 | Multi-modal (text, image, audioâ€¦)        |
| **Data Trained On** | Mainly text                   | Text + images + code + audio, etc.       |
| **Flexibility**     | Text-based tasks              | General-purpose, adaptable               |
| **Examples**        | GPT-3, BERT, LLaMA            | GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Grok              |
