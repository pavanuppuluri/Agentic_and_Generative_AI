## üß† What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

**RAG** is a technique that enhances the accuracy of language models by retrieving relevant external documents and injecting them into the generation process.

## üîÅ RAG Workflow

1. **User Query**
   - A user asks a question, e.g., ‚ÄúHow do I migrate from version 2.0 to 3.0?‚Äù

2. **Document Retrieval**
   - The system sends the query to a **Knowledge Base** (like AWS Bedrock‚Äôs).
   - It performs a **semantic search** over internal documents (FAQs, manuals, PDFs, etc.).

3. **Prompt Augmentation**
   - The retrieved documents are combined with the original query.

4. **LLM Response Generation**
   - A **foundation model** (e.g., Claude or Titan) in AWS Bedrock generates a response using the provided context.

5. **Answer Delivered**
   - The grounded, accurate response is returned to the user.

## üìå Example

### Input:
**User:** ‚ÄúHow can I migrate my data from version 2.0 to 3.0?‚Äù

### Retrieved Context:
> _‚ÄúTo migrate from version 2.0 to 3.0, export data in JSON format and use the import tool from Admin > Tools...‚Äù_

### LLM Output:
> ‚ÄúTo migrate your data, export it as JSON from version 2.0 and import it using the new tool in the Admin panel under Tools in version 3.0.‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Benefits of RAG
- Reduces hallucinations
- Leverages private, dynamic knowledge sources
- Avoids the need for full model fine-tuning
- Enables domain-specific accuracy
