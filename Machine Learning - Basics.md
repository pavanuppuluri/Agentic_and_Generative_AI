# Machine Learning

- Machine learning is a subset of AI
- In Machine Learning, the Algorithm is trained using the historical data to make predictions on new data

## 🎯 What is Supervised Learning in Machine Learning?

- In supervised learning, algorithms are trained using labelled dataset.
- Once the training is completed, the model is tested using test data and then it predicts the output.

There are 2 algorithms that we set with supervised learning.

- Classification
- Regression

**Classification Algorithm** classifies the input data into one of the pre-defined categories

A **Regression Algorithm** is a type of supervised learning algorithm used to predict continuous (real-valued) outcomes based on input features.

To find the relationship between independent variables (features) and a continuous dependent variable (target/output).

Unlike classification (which predicts categories), regression predicts numeric values.

**For example**:

Given the square footage of a house, predict its price.

**Real-World Examples**:

| 🧠 Problem                    | 📥 Input Features                         | 🎯 Output (Regression)         |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 🏠 House Price Prediction   | Area, location, bedrooms                 | Price in dollars ($)          |
| 👨‍⚕️ Blood Pressure Estimation | Age, weight, activity level             | Blood pressure value           |
| 📈 Stock Price Forecasting  | Previous prices, trading volume          | Next day’s stock price         |
| 🚗 Car Mileage Prediction   | Engine size, weight, horsepower          | Miles per gallon (MPG)         |


## 🎯 What is Unupervised Learning in Machine Learning?

- Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which algorithm are trained using unlabeled dataset
- Based on the dataset, model finds hidden patterns and insights based on the similarities of the data

There are 2 Key Algorithms that are used in Unsupervised Learning.

- Clustering
- Association

## ✅ Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
**Definition**:
Clustering is a technique in unsupervised learning that groups similar data points together based on their features — without using labels.

**Goal**:
Find natural groupings or patterns in data.

**Examples**:

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer Segmentation – Group users based on buying behavior
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Targeted Marketing - By segmenting users by shopping habits
- 📷 Image Organization – Group similar photos (e.g., by faces or scenes)
- 🌐 Website visitor grouping – Segment users by browsing activity

## ✅ Association Rule Learning (Unsupervised Learning)
**Definition**:
Association learning uncovers interesting relationships (rules) between items in large datasets.

**Goal**:
Identify co-occurrence patterns or “if-then” rules.

**Examples**:

- 🛒 Market Basket Analysis – "If a customer buys bread, they're likely to buy butter."
- 📚 Amazon Recommendations – "People who bought this also bought..."
- 🍕 Menu Bundling – "Pizza and Coke often sold together."
