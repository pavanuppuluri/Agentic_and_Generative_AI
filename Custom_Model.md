# Creating A Custom Model

#### Usecase

You want to build a text summarization app which captures the conversation between Physician & Patient,
converts that voice into text and summarises it.

**What if we use base model for this?**

Problem is, as base model is trained on generic internet data, may be it won't understand the Domain terminology.
In this case, we can create a Custom Model using below options

| **Fine-Tuning**              | Train the foundation model on labeled, task-specific data to tailor its behavior. | You need precise output aligned with specific tasks or brand tone.        | Fine-tune Titan on customer support chat logs to create a brand-aligned chatbot.    |
| **Knowledge Distillation**   | Compress a large (teacher) model into a smaller (student) model to reduce cost and latency. | You want cheaper, faster inference. Youâ€™ve fine-tuned a large model and want to deploy it in resource-constrained environments       | Deploy a smaller, faster version of a fine-tuned model for mobile customer support. |
| **Continued Pre-training**   | Further pretrain a foundation model on large amounts of unlabeled, domain-specific data. | You have lots of domain data but no labels, and want better vocabulary alignment. | Pretrain Titan with thousands of financial reports to enhance financial understanding. |
